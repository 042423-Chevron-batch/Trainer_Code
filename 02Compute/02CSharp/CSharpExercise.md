# C# Exercise: Hangman

- Given a random word, users have 6 wrong answers to guess the word
- If the character user guesses exist in the word, all occurrences of the character is filled in
- If the character user guesses does not exist in the word, it is added to the "wrong guesses" list and the user has one less life
- User wins the game if they correctly guesses the word before they run out of lives
- User loses the game if they run out of lives

## Objective
- Create a hangman game with C# Console Application with a partner
- You'll pair program this together
- Deploy this to your azure virtual machine and run from it
 
### Pairs:
Ishmael - Jvon
Daniel Obiri - Avery
Daniel Ademoye - Clint

We'll have a show and tell tomorrow morning

## Stretch Goals
- ASCII art for hangman
- A collection of words to randomly pick from
- Console colors
- Organize your code with methods
- dip your toes into OOP in C# by using classes
- and anything else you want to try
    - different data structures that exist in C# (List<T> etc)
