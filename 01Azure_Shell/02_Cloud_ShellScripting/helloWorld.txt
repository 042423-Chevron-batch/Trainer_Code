## Exercise: Grade Calculator
Given a score between 0 and 100, determine the letter grade for it. Use the following metric to assign grades:
- A: 90~100
- B: 80~89
- C: 70~79
- D: 60~69
- F: 0~60
Additionally, ask the user if they want to continue using the calculator, and repeat the conversion as long as they want.

### Stretch Goals
- Have a way to accept multiple scores at once
	- Output not just the grades, but also mean, median, and min/max of the grade collection
	- Accept a file with a flag/option
	- Save the result to a file
