## Git
Git is a version control system, which is software used to create multiple versions of a directory. Git is used daily by developers to create backups for our source code and to collaborate with other developers

## Source Code
Source code is your program/project

## Repository
Git repository or repo is source code plus the history of changes you've made

## Basic Git Workflow
1. make changes
2. Add to the staging area using `git add file-or-folder-name`
3. Commit with a meaningful message (For future you and your teammates) using `git commit -m "message here"`
	- to view your staging area, use `git status`

- `git clone repo-url` to download the remote repository URL to local machine
