# Week 1 Project
For this project, you will be writing an interactive project using shell scripting.

## Due : May 1, 2023 
Project completion will be demonstrated via the following ways: show and tell in front of the trainers and peers and code committed and pushed to github repository for code review.

## Requirement
- Project will be written in either bash or powershell
- Project will be version controlled, aka, be a part of a git repository. It should also be frequently committed/pushed to the remote repository in our github organization. (This means more than 2 commits (not this: initial commit -> project done!))
- The project should have be able to receive user inputs and change the behavior accordingly
- Project should also demonstrate understanding of variables and flow control- that is using things like if/else and/or loops

## Note
Depending on what you're wanting to do, you might be limited by git bash. In that case, either:
	1. Use an Azure VM
	2. Use Windows Subsystem Linux

### Totally Optional, but would be super cool, Stretch Goals
- Input validation
- Receive additional arguments
- Interact with the OS
- Utilizing some sort of data structure(array, etc)
- Anything else your heart desires

## Not sure what to build?
If you aren't sure what to build, here are some ideas to get you started
- Rock Paper Scissor
- Calculator
	- Given an operation (add, subtract, multiply, etc) and two operands, create an application that can successfully handle very simple arithmetic expression (1 + 2, 2 * 3, etc)
- Print shapes using asterisk(\*)
- Interactive Git sync command
	- Create a custom command that will add, commit, pull, and push for you
- Take a directory and modify all file/folder names in the directory
